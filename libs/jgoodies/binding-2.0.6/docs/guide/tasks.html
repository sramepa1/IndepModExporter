	 <h2>Adapting Domain Properties</h2>
	 
	 If the domain object properties are implemented as Java Bean properties,
	 they can be converted to ValueModels using a <tt>PresentationModel</tt>,
	 <tt>BeanAdapter</tt>, or <tt>PropertyAdapter</tt>. Typically you'll use
	 a PresentationModel, in some cases the simpler BeanAdapter, and only
	 if you want to convert a single property, you may consider using 
	 a PropertyAdapter.


	 <h2>Observing and Firing Property Changes</h2>
	 
	 In most cases we want to automatically update the view
	 of a bound domain property changes. More generally, 
	 we want to update a view if a bound value changes.
	 Therefore we must be able to register with the bound value
	 to get notified about changes. That's the second role
	 of the ValueModels - besides reading and writing values.
	 
	 <p>
	 The Java Bean standard describes a standard mechanism 
	 to report changes in property values and to listen to
	 these changes, or in other words, to observe values.
	 To make Bean properties bound, the bean class must
	 provide a pair of methods to add and remove a 
	 <tt>PropertyChangeListener</tt>. 
	 We use the same mechanism and exactly the same events
	 for all ValueModels in the JGoodies Binding.
	 
	 <p>
	 To minimize the effort required to make your bean
	 properties bound, you can extend the class <tt>Model</tt>
	 that provides all the methods necessary to fire events
	 and register listeners.
	 



	 <h2>Converting Values to Views</h2>
	 
	 To present a value with a Swing component, you can either
	 set the value in the component, or you can provide a component model
	 that will be used by the component to read and write values from/to.
	 If possible we favor the latter approach and therefore offer
	 a bunch of adapter classes that convert ValueModels into
	 the model interface required by the different Swing components.
	 For example, the <tt>RadioButtonAdapter</tt> is a model that converts
	 a ValueModel so it can be used with a <tt>JRadioButton</tt>. 
	 And the <tt>DocumentAdapter</tt> converts a ValueModel
	 into a <tt>Document</tt> implementation, for use in <tt>JTextField</tt>,
	 <tt>JTextArea</tt> and all other <tt>JTextComponents</tt>.
	 
	 <p>
	 The <tt>BasicComponentFactory</tt> can create Swing components
	 that are bound to a ValueModel; the factory chooses the appropriate
	 adapter. If you already have a component factory, or if you are using
	 customized versions of the standard Swing components, you can use
	 the more basic <tt>Bindings</tt> class. It establishes the connection
	 between a ValueModel and a given Swing component by setting the
	 appropriate ValueModel adapter as the component's model.
	 
	 
	 

	 <h2><a name="buffering">Buffering</a></h2>

     A <tt>BufferedValueModel</tt> is used to hold a temporary copy of 
     the value in another ValueModel (known as the subject). 
     The application modifies the temporary copy, but the 
     BufferedValueModel only gives this temporary value to its subject 
     when the application confirms the changes. 
     The application also has the option of canceling the changes, 
     resetting the temporary copy to the subject's value. 
     <p>
	For example, suppose the application provides a series of text fields 
	for entering customer name, address, phone, etc., but we only want 
	the Customer object to be updated after the user has finished 
	entering data and has indicated completion by clicking on an OK button. 
	This technique is often used in database applications, to postpone 
	updating the customer record in the database until all changes to that 
	record are completed. In this application, the customer's old address 
	would likely be held by an PropertyAdapter on the Customer bean. 
	The property adapter would become the subject of a BufferedValueModel. 
	The BufferedValueModel would make a temporary copy of the customer's 
	address and make that value available to the input field for editing. 
	The user could change the address, but so far only the temporary copy 
	has been altered. Only when the users clicks on 'OK' does the application 
	notify each field's BufferedValueModel to replace the corresponding value 
	in the Customer object. 
	<p>
    A BufferedValueModel is constructed for given ValueModels for the subject
    and trigger channel. The subject is a ValueModel containing the data value. 
    The trigger channel is a ValueHolder containing the boolean object false. 
    Later, when the user clicks on 'OK', the application can cause the 
    temporary copy to become the subject's value by setting the triggerChannel's 
    value to true. The application can also cancel any edits, by setting 
    the triggerChannel's value to false. Note that the prior value in 
    the triggerChannel is not significant - as long as a value change 
    is reported.
    <p>
    By using the same trigger channel for all of the BufferedValueModels, 
    the application can cause them all to be updated at the same time. 
    This is the usual arrangement for a set of related widgets. 
    
    
    <h2>Change Management</h2>
    
    You may want to detect whether the user has changed an object 
    in an editor to enable or disable a 'Save' action or an 'OK' button.
      
    Therefore you can compare the edited object's old and new values,
    or listen to object property changes, or observe the buffering state
    of BufferedValueModels - if you use any. 
    
    <p>
    Comparing old and new values is the most precise approach
    to detect whether things changed or not. But it requires 
    to duplicate the edited values and compare them later.
    You can copy (or clone) your domain objects and compare
    them after each change using a custom <tt>#equals</tt> implementation.
    
    <p>
    The classes PresentationModel and BeanAdapter provide a means
    to detect potential changes. They listen to all bean property
    changes and keep this state in a bound property <i>changed</i>.
    You can read, write and observe this state, for example to
    enable or disable Actions.
    
    <p>
    If you are buffering the edited values, you can listen to
    the BufferedValueModels <i>buffering</i> property to detect
    pending changes. 
    
    
    
	 <h2>Indirection</h2>

     Indirection is used to change the target object of a bound 
     object property from one target to another. For example,
     if you display a list of albums, and present the selection
     in a details panel, you want to change the target object
     whenever the selection changes. In other words, the details
     components are bound to the property of <em>an</em> object,
     the indirection tells the binding which object it is.
     
     <p>
     If you are using PresentationModel, BeanAdapter or PropertyAdapter to convert 
     Bean properties to ValueModels, you can set the current target bean 
     in these adapters using <tt>#setBean(Object)</tt>.
     
     <p>
     If multiple ValueModels shall be redirected from one target
     to another, you'll typically use a <em>bean channel</em>.
     That is another ValueModel that holds the target bean.
     And every interested party can observe changes in the 
     bean channel to change its target. The PresentationModel,
     BeanAdapter and PropertyAdapter already provide constructors 
     to use a bean channel.


	 <h2><a name="conversion">Type Conversion</a></h2>

	 The ValueModel interface operates on general Object instances. 
	 If you want to convert types, you can wrap a ValueModel and
	 perform the conversion while you get and set a value. 
     In addition you must convert the old and new value in all
	 <tt>PropertyChangeEvents</tt> fired by the wrapping ValueModel.
	 Class <tt>AbstractConverter</tt> minimizes the effort required
	 for such a conversion.
	 
	 <p>
	 Conversions among ValueModels are rare, just because most conversions
	 are required only for the presentation in the user interface.
	 The latter can often be handled using the <tt>JFormattedTextField</tt>
	 that provides a powerful means to format, parse, verify, and
	 modify objects. See also the JavaDoc class comment in 
	 <tt>AbstractConverter</tt>.


	<h2>Renaming Domain Properties</h2>
	
	If you use Java Bean properties in the domain layer,
	there are no direct references from the model or presentation layer
	to the domain. To access properties the property's name and
	the accessor names must by synchronized. This makes renaming properties
	a little bit harder.
	
	<p>
	I recommend to use String constants, not Strings, 
	for the property names. Then refer to these constants when
	getting ValueModels from a PresentationModel or when adding
	and removing listeners. Renaming a property is then a 2-step process:
	you rename 1) the getter and setter and 2) the property name constant.
	
	<p>
	Note that this renaming problem applies to code obfuscation too.
	Most code obfuscators rename the property accessor names,
	but leave the property name unchanged. Attempts to observe
	the property or to create an adapting ValueModel by the 
	property name will then fail. 
	Either you exclude the Bean accessors from the obfuscation, 
	or you use ValueHolders in the domain. I personally favor
	Beans and assume that most accessor names do not expose
	the domain logic to be hidden by the obfuscator.
