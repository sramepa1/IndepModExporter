	This document describes the API of the JGoodies Binding, a library
    that connects object properties with UI components.
    The Binding:<ul>
     	<li>reduces the code necessary for object presentation,
     	<li>stream-lines the development process for data binding,
     	<li>provides advanced features for automatic update notification,
     	<li>assists you in separating the domain and presentation layers.
     </ul>
     
     <p>
     Since version 2.0 the JGoodies Binding requires Java 5 or later. 
     The accompanying Binding tutorial sources require the 
     <a href="http://forms.dev.java.net/">JGoodies Forms</a> library 
     and use the 
     <a href="http://looks.dev.java.net/">JGoodies Looks</a> if in the classpath.
     Binding versions for Java 1.4 are available in the 
     <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/archive.html">JGoodies Archive</a>.
     
	 
	 <h3>Getting Started</h3>
	 
	 You can find presentation about Binding techniques at the 
	 <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/articles/" target="new">JGoodies Articles</a> page.
     Also check out the <i>User's Guide</i> in the accompanying HTML documentation.
     The accompanying tutorial sources demonstrate how to work with Binding.
     The package descriptions in these JavaDocs provide a reference 
     and many JavaDoc class comments contain example code.
     Also Martin Fowler describes the 
     <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html" target="new">Presentation Model pattern</a>
     in the upcoming <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/" target="new">additions</a> 
     to his "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture".
